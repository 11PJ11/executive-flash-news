# Acceptance Test Scenarios

## Current Active Scenario
### Scenario: Basic Welcome Widget Displays Successfully on Dashboard
- **Status**: Active (One E2E test enabled)
- **Business Value**: Establishes core plugin presence and validates technical foundation for future enhancements
- **Architecture Integration**: Tests Jira dashboard integration, plugin lifecycle, and basic widget rendering infrastructure

#### Given-When-Then Structure
```gherkin
Given a Jira user with dashboard access
  And the Executive Flash News plugin is installed and activated
When the user navigates to their Jira dashboard
Then the Executive Flash News widget should be visible on the dashboard
  And the widget should display "Welcome to Executive Flash News Plugin"
  And the widget should show the current plugin version number
  And the widget should render without errors
```

#### Step Implementation Guidelines
- Step methods MUST call production services via dependency injection
- Use appropriate language-specific patterns for unimplemented plugin services
- Focus on business language: "widget displays", "user sees welcome message"
- Validate business outcomes: widget presence, message visibility, version information

## Scenario Queue ([Ignore] Status)

### Scenario: User Role Detection and Personalized Greeting
- **Status**: [Ignore("Temporarily disabled - will enable after basic widget scenario completes")]
- **Priority**: High (Core personalization feature)
- **Dependencies**: Basic widget display must be working first

#### Given-When-Then Structure
```gherkin
Given a Jira user with "Project Manager" role
  And the Executive Flash News plugin is installed
When the user views their dashboard
Then the widget should detect the user's role
  And display "Welcome, Project Manager, to Executive Flash News Plugin"
  And the greeting should be personalized based on role identification
```

### Scenario: Plugin Version Management and Auto-Update Capability
- **Status**: [Ignore("Temporarily disabled - will enable after role detection completes")]
- **Priority**: Medium (Version management foundation)
- **Dependencies**: Basic widget and role detection features

#### Given-When-Then Structure
```gherkin
Given the current plugin version is "1.0.0"
  And a newer plugin version "1.1.0" is available
When the plugin checks for version updates
Then the widget should automatically update to display the newer version
  And the version number shown should change from "1.0.0" to "1.1.0"
  And the update should occur without user intervention
```

### Scenario: Plugin Loads Successfully in Jira Environment
- **Status**: [Ignore("Temporarily disabled - will enable after version management completes")]
- **Priority**: High (Technical foundation validation)
- **Dependencies**: All core features must be stable

#### Given-When-Then Structure
```gherkin
Given a Jira instance is running
  And the Executive Flash News plugin is deployed
When the Jira system starts up
Then the plugin should load without errors
  And the plugin should register with Jira's dashboard system
  And the plugin should be available for widget placement
  And no error logs should be generated during plugin initialization
```

### Scenario: Error Handling for Widget Rendering Issues
- **Status**: [Ignore("Temporarily disabled - will enable after successful plugin loading completes")]
- **Priority**: Medium (Robustness validation)
- **Dependencies**: Core plugin functionality established

#### Given-When-Then Structure
```gherkin
Given the Executive Flash News plugin is installed
  And there is a temporary connection issue with plugin services
When the user loads their dashboard
Then the widget should display a graceful error message
  And the message should be user-friendly: "Executive Flash News temporarily unavailable"
  And the widget should not crash the dashboard
  And the error should be logged for administrator review
```

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Hexagonal Architecture Integration

#### Ports (Business Interfaces)
- **IUserRoleService**: User identification and role detection
- **IPluginVersionService**: Version management and update coordination
- **IWelcomeMessageService**: Message generation and personalization
- **IJiraDashboardService**: Dashboard widget integration and rendering

#### Vertical Slice Validation
- **Complete User Journey**: From dashboard access to personalized welcome display
- **Plugin Lifecycle**: Installation, activation, widget rendering, version updates
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- **Integration Points**: Jira dashboard API, user authentication, plugin management

#### Environment Configuration Strategy
**Local Development Options** (User Choice Required):
- **Option 1**: In-Memory Only (Fastest - recommended for TDD cycles)
  - Use mock/stub implementations for all external services
  - Fastest feedback loop for development
- **Option 2**: Real Components Locally (More realistic integration testing)
  - Use actual Jira APIs and services locally
  - More realistic but slower feedback

**CI/CD Production-Like**:
- Always use real components in CI/CD pipeline
- Full integration with actual Jira services
- Production-like validation environment

### Quality Attribute Validation
- **Performance**: Widget renders within 2 seconds of dashboard load
- **Reliability**: Plugin maintains 99.5% uptime and graceful error handling
- **Usability**: Welcome message clearly visible and informative for all user roles
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation between Jira integration and business logic

### Business Outcome Focus
- **User Engagement**: Users can immediately identify plugin presence and purpose
- **Administrative Clarity**: Version information enables proper plugin management
- **Role-Based Experience**: Personalized greetings improve user experience relevance
- **Technical Foundation**: Walking skeleton provides solid base for future feature development

### Integration Test Strategy for Adapters

#### Adapter Testing Requirements
- **Jira Dashboard Adapter Testing**: Validate widget placement, styling, and user interaction
- **User Role Adapter Testing**: Verify Jira user API integration and role mapping accuracy
- **Version Management Adapter Testing**: Test Atlassian Marketplace integration and update mechanisms
- **No Business Logic in Adapters**: Adapters only translate between Jira APIs and business ports

**Test Class Naming Pattern**:
Following the `<ClassUnderTest>Should` pattern where test methods complete the sentence:

**Examples**:
- **Test Class**: `WelcomeWidgetShould`
- **Test Methods**:
  - `DisplayWelcomeMessageOnDashboard()`
  - `ShowCurrentPluginVersion()`
  - `RenderWithoutErrors()`

- **Test Class**: `JiraDashboardAdapterShould`
- **Test Methods**:
  - `RegisterWidgetSuccessfully()`
  - `HandleRegistrationFailuresGracefully()`

- **Test Class**: `UserRoleServiceShould`
- **Test Methods**:
  - `DetectProjectManagerRole()`
  - `ReturnDefaultRoleForUnknownUsers()`

## Implementation Notes

### Outside-In TDD Workflow
1. **Start with Active E2E Test**: Basic Welcome Widget Display scenario
2. **Drive Interface Design**: Create IWelcomeWidgetService through test requirements
3. **Implement Core Logic**: Welcome message generation and version display
4. **Add Infrastructure**: Jira dashboard integration through adapters
5. **Enable Next Scenario**: Remove [Ignore] from Role Detection scenario
6. **Repeat Cycle**: Continue until all scenarios implemented

### Walking Skeleton Focus
- **Minimal Viable Integration**: Simplest possible end-to-end flow from Jira dashboard to plugin widget
- **Real Integration Points**: Test actual Jira plugin APIs, not mocked interfaces
- **Business Value Validation**: Each scenario delivers measurable user value
- **Architectural Foundation**: Establishes patterns for future feature development

### Success Criteria
- All acceptance tests pass naturally through implementation (not modification)
- Plugin integrates seamlessly with Jira dashboard
- User experience meets stakeholder expectations from DISCUSS stage
- Technical foundation supports planned feature roadmap
- Code follows hexagonal architecture with clean adapter boundaries
