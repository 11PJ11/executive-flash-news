# Architecture Fix: Ports Relocated to Application Layer

## ✅ **Issue Identified and Resolved**

### **Problem:**
The `ports` folder was incorrectly placed under `src/domain/`, violating Hexagonal Architecture principles.

### **Root Cause:**
In proper Hexagonal Architecture:
- **Domain Layer**: Should contain ONLY pure business logic with no external dependencies
- **Application Layer**: Should contain ports (interfaces) and services that orchestrate business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Should contain adapters that implement the ports

### **Solution Applied:**
Moved ports from `domain` to `application` layer and updated all import paths.

## 🏗️ **Corrected Architecture**

### **Before (Incorrect):**
```
src/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/          ✅ Correct
│   └── ports/            ❌ WRONG - External contracts in domain layer
├── application/
│   ├── services/         ✅ Correct
│   └── resolvers/        ✅ Correct
└── infrastructure/
    └── adapters/         ✅ Correct
```

### **After (Correct):**
```
src/
├── domain/               ✅ Pure business logic only
│   └── entities/         ✅ Business entities (WelcomeMessage)
├── application/          ✅ Application coordination layer
│   ├── ports/           ✅ Interface definitions (contracts)
│   ├── services/        ✅ Business orchestration
│   └── resolvers/       ✅ Forge function resolvers
└── infrastructure/       ✅ External integrations
    └── adapters/        ✅ Port implementations
```

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **File Relocations:**
- `src/domain/ports/IUserRoleService.js` → `src/application/ports/IUserRoleService.js`
- `src/domain/ports/IPluginVersionService.js` → `src/application/ports/IPluginVersionService.js`

### **Import Path Updates:**
- `JiraUserRoleAdapter.js`: Fixed import from domain to application
- `StaticPluginVersionAdapter.js`: Fixed import from domain to application
- `jest.config.js`: Fixed ES module compatibility

## ✅ **Validation Results**

### **Tests Status:**
- ✅ **11/11 tests passing** (no regression)
- ✅ **1 E2E acceptance test** still functional
- ✅ **10 unit tests** for domain layer still working
- ✅ **Architecture integrity** maintained

### **Hexagonal Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic, no external dependencies
- ✅ **Application Layer**: Contains ports and orchestration services
- ✅ **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements application ports
- ✅ **Dependency Direction**: Infrastructure → Application → Domain (correct)

## 🎯 **Architectural Benefits**

### **Domain Purity:**
- Domain layer now contains only pure business logic
- No knowledge of external systems or infrastructure
- Easier to test and reason about

### **Clear Separation of Concerns:**
- **Domain**: Business rules (WelcomeMessage entity)
- **Application**: Contracts and orchestration (ports + services)
- **Infrastructure**: External integrations (Jira adapters)

### **Better Testability:**
- Domain entities can be tested in complete isolation
- Application services test business orchestration
- Infrastructure adapters test external integration

### **Improved Maintainability:**
- Changes to external systems only affect infrastructure layer
- Business logic changes only affect domain layer
- Clear boundaries make refactoring safer

## 📊 **Impact Assessment**

### **No Breaking Changes:**
- All tests continue to pass
- Functionality remains identical
- API contracts unchanged

### **Improved Code Quality:**
- Better adherence to Hexagonal Architecture
- Clearer separation of concerns
- More maintainable codebase structure

### **Enhanced Development Experience:**
- Clearer mental model for developers
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Better alignment with ATDD methodology

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
