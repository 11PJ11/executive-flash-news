# CI/CD Operations Runbook

Operational runbook for Executive Flash News CI/CD pipeline management, troubleshooting, and incident response.

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Critical Deployment Failure

**Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**
1. Check pipeline status in GitHub Actions
2. Review latest commit changes
3. Check health monitoring dashboard
4. Assess user impact

**Response Actions (5-15 minutes):**
1. Execute emergency rollback if needed:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to GitHub Actions
   # Run "Emergency Rollback" workflow
   # Select environment and provide reason
   ```
2. Create incident issue
3. Notify stakeholders via Slack/Teams
4. Document timeline and impact

### Production Health Alerts

**Assessment Steps:**
1. Run manual health check:
   ```bash
   node scripts/deployment-monitor.js health-check production
   ```
2. Check recent deployments
3. Review monitoring metrics
4. Verify third-party service status

**Response Based on Severity:**
- **P0 (Critical)**: Immediate rollback
- **P1 (High)**: Hot fix deployment
- **P2 (Medium)**: Schedule fix in next deployment
- **P3 (Low)**: Add to backlog

   - Ensure all PR checks pass
   - Get code review approval
   - Merge to `develop`

3. **Development Deployment**
   - Auto-triggered on `develop` merge
   - Monitor health checks
   - Verify functionality

4. **Staging Deployment**
   - Merge `develop` to `main`
   - Auto-deployment to staging
   - Full regression testing

5. **Production Release**
   - Create release from `main`
   - Auto-deployment to production
   - Monitor for 24 hours

### Environment Management

#### Environment Refresh

**Development Environment:**
```bash
# Refresh development with latest data
forge deploy --environment development --no-prompt

# Verify health
node scripts/deployment-monitor.js health-check development
```

**Staging Environment:**
```bash
# Deploy to staging
forge deploy --environment staging --no-prompt

# Run full test suite
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Environment Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **App Not Responding**
   ```bash
   # Check Forge logs
   forge logs --environment production

   # Verify installation
   forge install --site your-site --product jira
   ```

2. **Permission Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check app permissions
   forge whoami

   # Verify site access
   forge sites
   ```

3. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Clean build
   rm -rf node_modules dist
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```

4. Notify stakeholders
5. Begin investigation

**High Error Rate:**
1. Check recent deployments
2. Review error logs
3. Assess user impact
4. Determine if rollback needed

#### Medium Priority Alerts

**Slow Response Time:**
1. Check performance monitoring
2. Review recent changes
3. Optimize if needed
4. Schedule performance review

**Security Vulnerability:**
1. Assess severity (CVSS score)
2. Check if exploitable
3. Plan patching timeline
4. Communicate to security team

## üîê Security Operations

### Security Incident Response

**Potential Security Breach:**
1. **Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)**
