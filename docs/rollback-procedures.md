# Emergency Rollback Documentation

## Overview

Emergency rollback procedures for executive-flash-news Forge application to ensure rapid recovery from deployment issues or critical failures.

## Rollback Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Critical Application Failure
**Triggers**:
- Complete widget failure affecting all executives
- Security vulnerability requiring immediate isolation
- Data corruption or exposure incident
- Performance degradation >50% from baseline

**Decision Criteria**: Immediate rollback required within 15 minutes

### Scenario 2: Performance Degradation
**Triggers**:
- Response times >10 seconds consistently
- Error rates >10% for executive users
- Memory or resource exhaustion
- Jira API integration failures

**Decision Criteria**: Rollback if not resolved within 30 minutes

### Scenario 3: Feature Regression
**Triggers**:
- Key functionality broken for executives
- User authentication issues
- Data display errors
- Widget rendering failures

**Decision Criteria**: Rollback if impact affects >25% of executive users

## Automated Rollback Procedures

### CI/CD Pipeline Rollback

**GitHub Actions Rollback**:
```bash
# Emergency rollback via GitHub Actions
# Navigate to Actions tab â†’ Select failed deployment â†’ Re-run previous successful deployment

# Manual trigger via workflow dispatch
gh workflow run ci-cd.yml --ref main \
  --field skip_tests=true \
  --field rollback_version=v1.0.0
```

**Forge CLI Rollback**:
```bash
# Authenticate with Forge CLI
echo "$FORGE_API_TOKEN" | forge login --no-prompt

# List recent deployments
forge deploy --list

# Rollback to previous version
forge deploy --rollback --environment production

# Verify rollback success
forge deploy --status --environment production
```

### Automated Health Checks Post-Rollback
```bash
# Automated health check script
npm run health-check:production

# Expected responses:
# - Widget loads within 3 seconds
# - No JavaScript errors
# - Executive authentication working
# - Jira integration functional
```

## Manual Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Manual Rollback (Critical Issues)

**Step 1: Immediate Response (0-5 minutes)**
```bash
# Stop current deployment if in progress
forge deploy --abort --environment production

# Emergency disable app (if critical security issue)
forge install --uninstall --site $FORGE_PROD_SITE --no-prompt
```

**Step 2: Rollback Execution (5-15 minutes)**
```bash
# Authenticate
export FORGE_EMAIL=$FORGE_EMAIL
export FORGE_API_TOKEN=$FORGE_API_TOKEN
forge login --no-prompt

# Identify last known good version
git log --oneline -10
forge deploy --list --environment production

# Deploy previous version
git checkout <last-good-commit>
forge deploy --environment production --no-prompt

# Reinstall if uninstalled
forge install --site $FORGE_PROD_SITE --product jira --no-prompt
```

**Step 3: Validation (15-20 minutes)**
```bash
# Test critical functionality
npm run test:e2e:production
npm run health-check:production

# Manual verification checklist
# - Executive can access widget
# - Welcome message displays correctly
# - No console errors
# - Performance within acceptable range
```

### Partial Rollback Procedures

**Configuration-Only Rollback**:
```bash
# Rollback only app configuration without full redeployment
forge deploy --config-only --environment production

# Update environment variables if needed
forge env set ENVIRONMENT production
forge env set DEBUG false
```

**Feature Flag Rollback**:
```bash
# Disable problematic features via configuration
# (Future enhancement - feature flags not yet implemented)
forge env set FEATURE_EXECUTIVE_INSIGHTS false
forge deploy --config-only --environment production
```
