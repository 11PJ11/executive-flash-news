## Problem Summary

The Executive Flash News Jira plugin project has three critical issues that violate ATDD principles and system integrity:

1. **Acceptance tests are not testing the real end-to-end wiring**
2. **Unit tests are not related to the active acceptance test**
3. **Installation of AI-Craft agents and commands removed SuperClaude commands from global configuration**

## Evidence Collection

### System State Analysis

**Project Structure Evidence**:
- **Acceptance Test**: `WelcomeWidgetAcceptanceTests.test.js` - Uses real Forge CLI commands but lacks production service integration
- **Unit Test**: `WelcomeMessageShould.test.js` - Tests domain entity with proper ATDD naming patterns
- **Production Code**: `WelcomeMessage.js` - Domain entity with business logic implementation
- **Installation Logs**: AI-Craft installed 44 agents and 2 commands successfully on 2025-09-13

**Test Structure Evidence**:
- Acceptance test implements Given/When/Then pattern but calls infrastructure commands directly
- Unit test properly tests `WelcomeMessage` domain entity behavior
- No evidence of dependency injection setup connecting tests to production services
- Tests are isolated rather than integrated

**Configuration Evidence**:
- AI-Craft installation log shows successful installation of framework
- Claude local config shows basic permissions but no SuperClaude commands
- Backup directory contains historical configurations but no pre-AI-Craft SuperClaude backup

## Toyota 5 Whys Multi-Causal Investigation

### ISSUE 1: Acceptance Tests Not Testing Real End-to-End Wiring

#### WHY #1: Why are acceptance tests not testing real E2E wiring?
**Multiple Causes Identified**:

**Cause A**: Test infrastructure directly calls Forge CLI instead of production services
- **Evidence**: Lines 27-28, 41-42, 52-53 show direct `execAsync('forge --version')`, `execAsync('forge deploy')`, `execAsync('forge install')` calls
- **Impact**: Tests validate CLI tooling rather than application integration

**Cause B**: No dependency injection container configured for tests
- **Evidence**: No service provider setup in test files, no production service instantiation
- **Impact**: Tests cannot access production services through proper DI patterns

**Cause C**: Step methods implement test infrastructure logic rather than delegating to production services
- **Evidence**: Given/When/Then lambdas contain infrastructure setup code instead of service calls
- **Impact**: Tests pass based on CLI success rather than business logic validation

#### WHY #2: Why do these conditions exist?
**Branch Investigation**:

**Cause A Context**: Why does test infrastructure call CLI directly?
- **Evidence**: Test setup focuses on environment validation rather than service integration
- **Contributing Factor**: Forge-specific tooling requires CLI interaction for deployment

**Cause B Context**: Why is no DI container configured?
- **Evidence**: No service registration, no test environment setup with production services
- **Contributing Factor**: ATDD implementation prioritized test structure over service wiring

**Cause C Context**: Why do step methods contain infrastructure logic?
- **Evidence**: Methods like `forgeEnvironmentIsConfigured()` implement CLI checks instead of service delegation
- **Contributing Factor**: Focus on infrastructure readiness rather than business behavior validation

#### WHY #3: Why do these systemic conditions persist?
**System Analysis**:

**System A**: Why does system lack service integration layer?
- **Evidence**: No adapter layer between tests and production services
- **System Factor**: Hexagonal architecture partially implemented - missing adapter wiring

**System B**: Why does system not enforce production service usage in tests?
- **Evidence**: Test validation passes without production service invocation
- **System Factor**: No architectural safeguards preventing infrastructure-only testing

**System C**: Why does system allow tests to bypass business logic?
- **Evidence**: Tests can pass without exercising domain entities or use cases
- **System Factor**: Test execution path doesn't require business logic validation

#### WHY #4: Why weren't these design gaps anticipated?
**Design Analysis**:

**Design A**: Why wasn't service integration designed into tests?
- **Evidence**: Test architecture designed around CLI tooling rather than service patterns
- **Design Gap**: ATDD implementation focused on test structure, not service integration

**Design B**: Why wasn't production service usage enforced?
- **Evidence**: No validation requiring production service invocation in step methods
- **Design Gap**: Missing architectural constraints ensuring production code path coverage

**Design C**: Why wasn't business logic validation required?
- **Evidence**: Tests can pass without domain entity or use case execution
- **Design Gap**: Test design allows infrastructure validation to substitute for business validation

#### WHY #5: Why do these fundamental design conditions exist?
**Root Causes**:

**Root Cause 1**: ATDD implementation misunderstanding - focused on test structure rather than production service integration
**Root Cause 2**: Hexagonal architecture incomplete - missing test adapter layer connecting tests to production services
**Root Cause 3**: Outside-In TDD process deviation - tests written to validate infrastructure rather than drive business implementation

### ISSUE 2: Unit Tests Not Related to Active Acceptance Test

#### WHY #1: Why are unit tests disconnected from acceptance tests?
**Multiple Causes Identified**:

**Cause A**: Unit tests focus on domain entity in isolation rather than acceptance test requirements
- **Evidence**: `WelcomeMessageShould.test.js` tests `WelcomeMessage` class behavior independently
- **Impact**: Unit tests don't drive the implementation needed to make acceptance tests pass

**Cause B**: Acceptance test requires Forge infrastructure integration, unit tests focus on business logic
- **Evidence**: Acceptance test calls `execAsync('forge deploy')`, unit tests call `new WelcomeMessage()`
- **Impact**: Different implementation paths, no integration point

**Cause C**: No intermediate service layer to bridge acceptance requirements and unit implementation
- **Evidence**: No application services or use cases connecting E2E scenarios to domain logic
- **Impact**: Tests operate at different architectural levels without connection

#### WHY #2: Why does this disconnection exist?
**Branch Investigation**:

**Cause A Context**: Why do unit tests focus on entities instead of acceptance scenarios?
- **Evidence**: Unit tests follow domain-driven design patterns for entity testing
- **Contributing Factor**: TDD cycle started with domain entities rather than acceptance requirements

**Cause B Context**: Why do acceptance tests require infrastructure integration?
- **Evidence**: Forge platform requires CLI tooling for deployment and installation
- **Contributing Factor**: Forge-specific requirements create infrastructure dependency

**Cause C Context**: Why is no service layer bridging the gap?
- **Evidence**: No application services, use cases, or command handlers in codebase
- **Contributing Factor**: Hexagonal architecture missing application layer

#### WHY #3: Why do these systemic disconnections persist?
**System Analysis**:

**System A**: Why does system lack application service layer?
- **Evidence**: Direct jump from acceptance tests to domain entities
- **System Factor**: Incomplete hexagonal architecture - missing application layer

**System B**: Why does system not connect test levels?
- **Evidence**: Acceptance tests and unit tests validate different concerns
- **System Factor**: No architectural pattern ensuring test level integration

**System C**: Why does system allow disconnected test development?
- **Evidence**: Unit tests can be written without reference to acceptance requirements
- **System Factor**: No workflow ensuring unit tests drive acceptance test implementation

#### WHY #4: Why weren't these integration gaps anticipated?
**Design Analysis**:

**Design A**: Why wasn't application service layer designed?
- **Evidence**: Architecture jumps directly from UI to domain
- **Design Gap**: Hexagonal architecture understanding incomplete - missing application layer

**Design B**: Why wasn't test level integration planned?
- **Evidence**: ATDD process doesn't enforce unit test driving acceptance test requirements
- **Design Gap**: Outside-In TDD process understanding incomplete - missing integration requirements

**Design C**: Why wasn't service orchestration designed?
- **Evidence**: No orchestration between domain logic and infrastructure requirements
- **Design Gap**: Missing service composition patterns for complex platform integration

#### WHY #5: Why do these fundamental design conditions exist?
**Root Causes**:

**Root Cause 1**: Incomplete Outside-In TDD methodology - unit tests not driven by acceptance test requirements
**Root Cause 2**: Hexagonal architecture misunderstanding - missing application service layer to bridge E2E and domain
**Root Cause 3**: Platform integration complexity underestimated - Forge requirements create architectural complexity

### ISSUE 3: AI-Craft Installation Removed SuperClaude Commands

#### WHY #1: Why did AI-Craft installation remove SuperClaude commands?
**Multiple Causes Identified**:

**Cause A**: Installation overwrote command directory structure
- **Evidence**: AI-Craft installed to `~/.claude/commands/cai/` with 2 command files
- **Impact**: Previous SuperClaude commands may have been in same directory space

**Cause B**: No pre-installation backup of existing commands
- **Evidence**: Installation log shows "No existing AI-Craft installation found, skipping backup"
- **Impact**: No preservation of pre-existing command structure

**Cause C**: Installation process doesn't account for existing framework commands
- **Evidence**: Installation focused on AI-Craft framework, not preservation of existing commands
- **Impact**: Replacement rather than integration with existing tools

#### WHY #2: Why do these installation conditions exist?
**Branch Investigation**:

**Cause A Context**: Why does installation overwrite command directory?
- **Evidence**: Installation targets specific directory structure without conflict resolution
- **Contributing Factor**: AI-Craft designed as complete framework replacement

**Cause B Context**: Why no backup of existing commands?
- **Evidence**: Backup logic only checks for existing AI-Craft installation
- **Contributing Factor**: Installation designed for clean installation, not upgrade

**Cause C Context**: Why no integration with existing frameworks?
- **Evidence**: Installation process is framework-specific, not ecosystem-aware
- **Contributing Factor**: AI-Craft developed independently of SuperClaude integration

#### WHY #3: Why do these systemic installation behaviors persist?
**System Analysis**:

**System A**: Why does system lack cross-framework compatibility?
- **Evidence**: Installation process doesn't detect or preserve other frameworks
- **System Factor**: Framework-centric design without ecosystem consideration

**System B**: Why does system not validate existing configurations?
- **Evidence**: No pre-installation validation of existing command structures
- **System Factor**: Installation assumes clean state rather than mixed environment

**System C**: Why does system allow destructive installation?
- **Evidence**: Installation can remove existing functionality without warning
- **System Factor**: No safety checks preventing loss of existing capabilities

#### WHY #4: Why weren't these integration conflicts anticipated?
**Design Analysis**:

**Design A**: Why wasn't cross-framework compatibility designed?
- **Evidence**: AI-Craft designed as standalone framework
- **Design Gap**: No consideration of existing framework ecosystem

**Design B**: Why wasn't conflict detection designed?
- **Evidence**: Installation process doesn't check for existing commands or configurations
- **Design Gap**: No safety mechanisms preventing destructive changes

**Design C**: Why wasn't incremental installation designed?
- **Evidence**: All-or-nothing installation approach
- **Design Gap**: No options for selective installation or framework coexistence

#### WHY #5: Why do these fundamental design conditions exist?
**Root Causes**:

**Root Cause 1**: Framework isolation mindset - AI-Craft developed without ecosystem awareness
**Root Cause 2**: Installation safety oversight - no preservation of existing configurations during setup
**Root Cause 3**: Integration design gap - no consideration of multi-framework coexistence patterns

## Interconnection Analysis

### Cross-Problem Dependencies

**Architectural Pattern Failure**:
- All three issues stem from incomplete architectural understanding
- ATDD/TDD implementation, Hexagonal architecture, and framework integration all partially implemented
- Creates systemic complexity and integration failures

**Design Methodology Gaps**:
- Outside-In TDD process not fully understood across team
- ATDD methodology focused on structure rather than integration
- Framework installation lacks ecosystem integration patterns

**System Integration Challenges**:
- Forge platform complexity creates unique integration requirements
- Multiple framework paradigms (SuperClaude, AI-Craft, ATDD) create conflicts
- Lack of unified integration strategy causes fragmentation

### Reinforcing Failure Cycles

**Test Implementation Cycle**:
1. Acceptance tests focus on infrastructure validation
2. Unit tests focus on isolated business logic
3. No service layer bridges the gap
4. Both test types can pass without system integration
5. Integration failures remain hidden until deployment

**Framework Conflict Cycle**:
1. Multiple frameworks installed without integration planning
2. Installation processes overwrite existing configurations
3. Capability loss occurs without detection
4. Development workflow disrupted
5. Team productivity reduced
