# Walking Skeleton Implementation Plan - Executive Flash News

## Project Context
- **Project Type**: Existing Atlassian Forge app requiring architectural validation
- **Current State**: Minimal widget implementation with comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
- **Timeline**: Target completion: 1-2 weeks maximum
- **Team Size**: Single developer with potential stakeholder feedback

## Architecture Component Map

### Core Components to Link
- **Frontend Layer**: Forge UI Kit (React-based), TypeScript support
- **API Layer**: Forge resolver functions, Jira REST API integration
- **Business Logic**: Domain entities, application services, business orchestration
- **Data Layer**: Forge Storage API, Jira project data access
- **Authentication**: Atlassian identity integration, user context management
- **Infrastructure**: Node.js 20.x runtime, CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Critical Integration Points
- **Forge UI ↔ Resolver Functions**: Component rendering with data fetching
- **Resolver Functions ↔ Jira API**: Secure API access with permission scopes
- **Domain Logic ↔ Application Services**: Business rule implementation and coordination
- **Forge Storage ↔ Business Data**: Persistence and retrieval of user preferences/settings
- **CI/CD Pipeline ↔ Forge Platform**: Automated deployment and validation

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Existing Implementation Status
- ✅ **Forge Manifest**: Configured for Jira dashboard widget with proper scopes
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive 8-stage validation with ATDD compliance
- ✅ **Basic Widget**: Minimal welcome message implementation in `src/index.js`
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure**: Jest configuration with E2E acceptance tests structure
- ✅ **Multi-Environment**: Development, staging, production configurations
- ❌ **Hexagonal Architecture**: Only single `index.js` file, missing domain/application layers
- ❌ **Data Integration**: No Jira API integration or business data processing
- ❌ **User Context**: No role detection or personalization features

### Gap Analysis
1. **Missing Domain Layer**: No business entities or domain logic implementation
2. **Missing Application Layer**: No service orchestration or business workflows
3. **Missing Infrastructure Layer**: No Jira API adapters or external integrations
4. **Limited UI Components**: Single static welcome message
5. **No Data Flow**: No integration with actual Jira project data

## Selected Walking Skeleton Feature

### Feature Description
**Core Feature**: Executive Project Status Dashboard Widget
**User Story**: "As an executive user, I want to see my portfolio health summary and critical alerts on my Jira dashboard so that I can quickly assess project status and take action on urgent issues"

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given an executive user is logged into Jira
And the Executive Flash News widget is installed on their dashboard
When the user views their dashboard
Then they should see:
  - A professional "Executive Portfolio Health" panel
  - Current user's name and detected role (if available)
  - Portfolio health score (calculated from project data)
  - Count of critical alerts requiring attention
  - Last updated timestamp
And the widget should load within 3 seconds
And display gracefully if no project data is available
```

### Architectural Path
```
Jira Dashboard → Forge UI Component → Resolver Function → Application Service → Domain Logic → Jira API Adapter → Jira REST API
     ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓                  ↓              ↓                  ↓
[Forge UI Kit]  [React Component]   [resolver.js]   [PortfolioService]  [Portfolio Entity] [JiraAdapter]    [Jira Cloud]

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Domain Layer Implementation
```javascript
// src/domain/entities/Portfolio.js
export class Portfolio {
  constructor(executiveId, projects) {
    this.executiveId = executiveId;
    this.projects = projects;
    this.healthScore = this.calculateHealthScore();
    this.criticalAlerts = this.identifyCriticalAlerts();
  }

  calculateHealthScore() {
    // Business logic for portfolio health calculation
  }

  identifyCriticalAlerts() {
    // Business logic for critical alert identification
  }
}
```

### Application Layer Implementation
```javascript
// src/application/services/PortfolioHealthService.js
export class PortfolioHealthService {
  constructor(jiraAdapter, storageAdapter) {
    this.jiraAdapter = jiraAdapter;
    this.storageAdapter = storageAdapter;
  }

  async getExecutivePortfolioHealth(userId) {
    // Orchestrate data retrieval and business logic
    const projects = await this.jiraAdapter.getProjectsForUser(userId);
    const portfolio = new Portfolio(userId, projects);
    return portfolio;
  }
}
```

### Infrastructure Layer Implementation
```javascript
// src/infrastructure/adapters/JiraAdapter.js
import { api } from '@forge/api';

export class JiraAdapter {
  async getProjectsForUser(userId) {
    // Forge API integration for project data
    const response = await api.asUser().requestJira('/rest/api/3/search', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        jql: 'project in projectsLeadByUser(currentUser())',
        fields: ['summary', 'status', 'priority', 'updated']
      })
    });
    return response.json();
  }
}
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks Validated
- **Forge Platform Integration**: **High** - Validate Forge CLI setup and deployment pipeline → **Mitigation**: Comprehensive CI/CD testing
- **Jira API Complexity**: **Medium** - Test API authentication and data retrieval → **Mitigation**: Incremental API integration with error handling
- **Performance with Real Data**: **Medium** - Measure actual load times with Jira data → **Mitigation**: Performance testing and caching strategy
