# Development Plan

## Completed Sprint Goals ✅
Successfully implemented authentication and authorization controls for executive data security using Outside-In ATDD methodology. The system now protects sensitive portfolio information from unauthorized access while providing seamless access for authorized executives.

## Completed E2E Scenario ✅
### Scenario: Executive Authentication and Authorization for Portfolio Access
- **Business Goal**: ✅ COMPLETE - Only authorized executives can access sensitive portfolio data, with confidential business information protected while maintaining seamless user experience for legitimate users
- **Architecture Impact**: ✅ COMPLETE - Integrated with Forge platform authentication and implemented role-based access control throughout the hexagonal architecture layers
- **Step Method Requirements**: ✅ COMPLETE - Production services implemented for user authentication, authorization validation, and secure data filtering

## Unit Test Strategy
### Red-Green-Refactor Approach
- **Red**: Write failing unit test for specific security behavior
- **Green**: Write minimal code to make test pass
- **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
- **Build & Test**: Always build and test after each change to exercise most recent logic

#### Build and Test Protocol for TDD Cycles
```bash
# After every change in the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
# 1. BUILD: Ensure we exercise the most recent logic
npm run build

# 2. TEST: Run tests with fresh build
npm test

# If build fails: Fix compilation before continuing
# If tests fail: Continue TDD cycle or rollback if unexpected failure
# If both pass: Continue to next TDD step
```

### Production Service Focus
- All step methods call production services via dependency injection
- Unit tests drive production service implementation
- Test infrastructure handles setup/teardown only

## Implementation Tasks
### Current Task: Implement Executive Authentication E2E Test
- **Unit Test**: Failing E2E test for executive accessing portfolio with valid authentication
- **Production Service**: AuthenticationService and AuthorizationService via Forge platform
- **Expected Behavior**: Executive authenticates through Forge, accesses authorized portfolio data only

### Next Tasks
1. Implement user authentication through Forge platform integration
2. Create authorization service for role-based access control
3. Add security filters to portfolio data access
4. Implement secure data handling in domain layer
5. Add audit logging for executive data access
